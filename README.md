# 🍅 Pomodoro Timer

A clean, minimalist, and web-based **Pomodoro Timer** designed to help you stay focused and productive. This application follows the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique), breaking work into intervals (typically 25 minutes) separated by short breaks.

## 📖 Project Description

This project is a lightweight productivity tool built for students, developers, and professionals who want to manage their time effectively. The goal of this application is to provide a distraction-free interface where users can quickly start a focus session without any complex setup.

### **How it Works**

1. **Work (Pomodoro):** Focus on a single task for 25 minutes.
2. **Short Break:** Take a 5-minute breather to recharge.
3. **Long Break:** After 4 focus sessions, take a longer 15-minute rest.

## ✨ Features

* **Pre-set Modes:** Toggle easily between **Pomodoro**, **Short Break**, and **Long Break**.
* **Interactive UI:** Large, easy-to-read digital countdown.
* **Dynamic Controls:** Start, Pause, and Reset functionality.
* **Responsive Design:** Works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile browsers.
* **Visual Themes:** UI updates visually depending on the session type (Work vs. Rest).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This project is built using modern front-end technologies:

* **HTML5:** For the semantic structure of the application.
* **CSS3:** For custom styling, layout (Flexbox/Grid), and responsive design.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** For the timer logic, state management, and DOM manipulation.
